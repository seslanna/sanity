# sanity

The design of Sanity typeface is modernized by abandoning any characteristics associated with hand writing, such as curved lines or elaborate corner details. The design is based on a rigid geometric grid and radiates confidence with its daring contrasts and provocative style. 
In large amounts of text the font “Sanity” can be hard to read due to a «dazzle» effect caused by alternating thick and thin strokes, particularly as the thin strokes are hardly visible at small point si es. Due to this quality, the “Sanity” font-family is best suitable for titles or large print advertisements. 
There are five key stylistic principles taken as a main framework for the creation of the “Sanity”: symmetry, contrast, geometry, artificiality and monospacing.
